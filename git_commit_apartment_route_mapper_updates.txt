Fix Xcode project structure and restore project.pbxproj

## Summary
Completely restructured the iOS project to eliminate triple-nested directories and restore proper Xcode project configuration for successful building on macOS.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure Fixes
- Eliminated triple-nested ApartmentRouteMapper/ApartmentRouteMapper/ApartmentRouteMapper structure
- Reorganized to standard Xcode project layout with single nesting level
- Moved all Swift source files to correct locations maintaining folder organization

### Project File Restoration
- Created new comprehensive project.pbxproj file from scratch
- Added all 14 Swift source files with correct relative paths:
  - Root: ApartmentRouteMapperApp.swift, ContentView.swift
  - Models/: Apartment.swift, Route.swift
  - Views/: MapView.swift, ApartmentListView.swift, AddressSearchView.swift, RouteDetailView.swift, RouteListView.swift
  - ViewModels/: ApartmentListViewModel.swift, MapViewModel.swift
  - Services/: LocationService.swift, CoreDataService.swift, RouteOptimizationService.swift
- Restored test target with RouteOptimizationTests.swift

### Build Configuration
- Configured for iOS 17.0 deployment target
- Set Swift 5.0 language version
- Added proper build phases for sources and resources
- Configured test target with proper dependencies
- Set up Info.plist with location permissions
- Added Core Data model references

### File Organization
- 14 source files properly organized in subdirectories
- 1 test file in ApartmentRouteMapperTests/
- Assets.xcassets and Preview Content correctly placed
- Info.plist at proper location with required keys

## Files Affected
- ApartmentRouteMapper.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (recreated)
- All Swift files relocated to proper directory structure
- Removed redundant nested directories
- Cleaned up duplicate project files

## Testing Notes
- Project should now open successfully in Xcode on macOS
- Development Team needs to be set in Signing & Capabilities
- All files are properly referenced and should compile
- Test target is configured and ready to run

## Technical Details
- Bundle ID: com.apartment.routemapper
- Supports iPhone and iPad (Universal)
- Includes location services for apartment mapping
- Core Data persistence for route storage
- TSP algorithm implementation for route optimization

This restructuring ensures the project follows standard iOS/Xcode conventions and can be successfully built and deployed from any macOS development environment.
